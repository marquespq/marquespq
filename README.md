Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a UI library using React, TypeScript and Tailwind.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques.  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source React projects.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving type declarations in my TypeScript projects.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and agile methodologies.  
âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy playing football, eating great food, and studying new technologies in my spare time.
